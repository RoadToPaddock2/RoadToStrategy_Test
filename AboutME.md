Hi! I am sharing my passion to motorsport on Tiktok (roadtopaddock2). Not only for fun, also with a big goal. One day I want to work in the motorsport paddock. Traveling from track to track. Thats why I start now to build up a community. I am still in school, so thats the perfact time. With my passion and discipline, I will make it. I swear! (Would be kind to follow my jounrey on TikTok)
